# Web Scraping using an API
# What is an API ?
James Dickens
# API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is
# a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each
# other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant
# message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.

# Informally, an API is code, software, an electronic system, that
# makes it possible for information or data to be retrieved and
# interpreted.

# The link to an excellent post describing API's in more detail is
# given below

# https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api

# In order to obtain the services of an organization's API, it is 
# common to use what is called an API key. An API key is a code
# identifier that gives the user access.

# We will use an API key in the process of retrieving data from the
# US Census Bureau.

# Use this link to get a census API Key

# From the US census data bank, we will get the median age by state
